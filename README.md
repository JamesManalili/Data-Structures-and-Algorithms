# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of Java programs developed during my Data Structures and Algorithms course. Most of the program implementations rely on user-defined functions without utilizing pre-defined libraries.

# Java Programs
## Queue Algorithm with GUI
__GUI Components__
  - __Enqueue button:__ Add a number to the queue.
  - __Dequeue button:__ Remove the front element from the queue.
  - __Top button:__ Display the front element of the queue.
  - __Exit button:__ Close the program.
  - __10 JTextFields__ to display queued items.
  - __JLabel named "note"__ indicating if the queue is full or empty.
  - __One JTextField__ for user input.

## Sorting Algorithms
__Contains the following Sorting Algorithms:__
  - __Bubble Sort__
  - __Quick Sort__
  - __Insertion Sort__
  - __Merge Sort__
    
__Usage__
  - Input the size of the array.
  - Enter elements to be sorted.

## String Manipulation / Other Programs 
__Reverse the Number in Array__
- Utilizes a for loop to reverse the elements in an array.

__Sum of Digits in Array__
- Calculates the sum of digits in the array.

__Palindrome Checking__
- Checks if the given input is a palindrome.

__String Comparison__
- Compares two strings.

__String Concatenation__
- Concatenates two strings.

__Copy a String__
- Creates a copy of the given string.

__Reverse the First String__
- Reverses the characters in the first string.

__Convert String to Upper and Lower Case__
- Converts a string to both upper and lower case.
